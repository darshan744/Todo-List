# Todo-List Web Application

This project is a simple todo-list application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add todo items with due dates, delete them individually, and see the updated list dynamically on the webpage.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Features

- **Add Todo Items:** Enter a todo item and its due date, then click "Add" to add it to the list.
- **Delete Todo Items:** Each todo item has a "Delete" button that removes the item from the list.

## Validation

Alerts users if they try to add a todo item without entering a name or date.

## Skills Gained

- **HTML:** Practiced structuring web pages and using form elements (`input` and `button`).
- **CSS:** Styled the application using basic CSS for layout and button styles.
- **JavaScript:**
  - Implemented dynamic rendering of todo items using DOM manipulation (`document.querySelector`, `innerHTML`).
  - Implemented event handling (`addEventListener`) for adding and deleting todo items.
  - Validated user input to ensure both todo name and due date are entered before adding to the list.
